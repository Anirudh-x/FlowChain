# 🚀 Flowchain AI  
**Generative Decision Support for Supply Chains**

Flowchain AI is a **Generative AI–driven decision support system** that helps industries transform raw supply chain data into **clear, actionable decisions** for inventory and demand management.

---

## 🧠 Problem
Supply chain teams have data, dashboards, and forecasts — but still struggle to:
- Detect overstocking and understocking early
- Understand demand vs inventory mismatches
- Convert analytics into **clear operational actions**

Most tools stop at numbers, not decisions.

---

## 💡 Solution
Flowchain AI acts as a **virtual supply chain analyst** by combining:
- Deterministic SCM metrics
- Visual dashboards
- AI-assisted, explainable recommendations

Instead of only showing data, it answers:
> **“What should be done next — and why?”**

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Decision-Centric Dashboard**  
  Inventory health, demand vs inventory trends, and alerts

- **Modular SCM Views (Preview Pages)**  
  Inventory, Orders, Analytics, and Settings to demonstrate scalability

- **AI-Assisted Insights**  
  Human-readable recommendations (rule-based prototype, LLM-ready)

- **Clean Enterprise UI**  
  Separate landing page, operational dashboard, optional dark mode
